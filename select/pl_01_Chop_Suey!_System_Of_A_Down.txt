Wake up
Grab a brush and put a little
make up
Hide the scars to fade away the
shake up
Why'd you leave the keys upon
the table
Here you go create another table
You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little
make up
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the
shake up
You wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon
the table
You wanted to
I don't think you trust
In my self righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
<♪>

Father into your hands
I commend my spirit
Father into your hands
why have you forsaken me
In your eyes forsaken me
In your thoughts forsaken me
In your heart forsaken me oh
Trust in my
self righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
