Wake up, grab a brush
And put on a little makeup
Hide the scars
And fade away that shakeup

Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to
Why did you leave the keys upon the table??

I don't think you trust
In my self righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

Je ne vous pense pas vous trust
Dans mon self righteous suicide
Je cry when angels deserve to

Father, father
Fucker, fucker

Father into your hands
I command my spirit
Father into your hands
Why have you forsaken me?
Why have you forsaken me?

I don't think you trust
In my self righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to

Die, ladies and gentleman
